## Team 6 Movie analysis


## Let's make a movie

### Project Description

In this project, we will be analyzing popular movies over the last 10 years to identify the key factors that contributes to a movie's success.

In the process, we will also be able to determine trends in genre popularity over the years, movies budgets, viewers ratings, revenues based on genres and other analyses in the motion picture industry.

These insights are important for filmmakers, producers, casts and even the audience.



### Technology Requirements

- **VS Code/Jupyter Notebook/Google colab**: For documentation and interactive data analysis.
- **Python**: For data mining, analysis, modeling and processing.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: For data cleaning, manipulation and numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and colormap handling.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization



### Dataset

The data set used in this project is relevant as it provides detailed information on movies released in the last 10 years. Such information includes data on movie titles, genres, budget, ratings etc. These are important data in our analysis and making our prediction.
